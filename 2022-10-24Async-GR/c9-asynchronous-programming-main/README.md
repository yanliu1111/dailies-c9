# Asynchronous Programming

> October 24, 2022

Hi guys, here you can find the code for our Asynchronous Programming session.

## Code structure

- **Review:** The [./review](./review) folder contains the code examples used for our variable/scope and functions/arguments review.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** The [./asynchronous-programming](./asynchronous-programming) folder contains the code examples relating to async programming (sync vs. async, callbacks, promises, `async`/`await`)
- **Fetch Practice:** The [./fetch-practice](./fetch-practice) folder contains the code we wrote together to learn `fetch()` (with postal codes and representatives)
