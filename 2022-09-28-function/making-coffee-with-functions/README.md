# Making Coffee with Functions

This project is an introduction to writing FUNCTIONS in JavaScript.

Each directory contains the code for a stand-alone program that can be run using the `node` command.
The first program is very basic, and each iteration evolves the code while increasing the programs
capabilities.

Code that is organized into functions, and functions that are organized into files, makes for a
readable, understandable and maintainable software project.
