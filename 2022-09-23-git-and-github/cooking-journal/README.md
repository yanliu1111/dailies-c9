### local repo and remote repo

A typical sequence of events in a developer’s day:
○ A developer will work locally on their own system in a Local Repo, making changes to
code.
○ When code is finally working, they ==add== the changes to “staging” (this must be done
before you can commit the changes);
○ They then =commit== the changes to create a “snapshot” of your project;
○ They ==push== the changes to a Remote Repo (i.e. GitHub) when the changes are
ready to be shared or deployed.
■ Note: you must ==pull== any new changes from the Remote Repo before you
can push. This is when dreaded merge conflicts need to be handled.

At any point during development, you can view the ==status== of your repo to find helpful
information of the status of your project.

==**every commit + git status **== to view the status

in Terminal, master and main means you are in repo. They are same. Old way and new way(GitHub)

==PLEASE!!! DONT repo inside repo==

It’s a pain, but you always have to ==add== your changes before you ==commit== them.
This is to prevent you from accidentally committing code you didn’t mean to.

Don’t forget to add the ==-m “commit message here”== when using the ==git
commit== command. Otherwise, your terminal will open a ==vim== window so you
can add the mandatory commit message. **<u>It’s the default command line text</u>
<u>editor</u>** on most systems and is not the most intuitive application to use. See
this [Vim cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/vim) if you need a command (:==q!== will quit without saving so
you can try committing again with the ==-m== flag).
